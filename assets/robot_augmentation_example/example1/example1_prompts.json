    "prompt1": "a robotic grasp an apple from the table and move it to another place.",
    "prompt2": "In a sleek, high-end kitchen flooded with warm, diffused LED lighting, a bi-manual robot precisely grasps a shiny red apple from the center of a granite countertop. Around it, a cast-iron pan, a chrome toaster, and a decorative plant sit neatly arranged. As the robot lifts the fruit, it pivots gracefully and places the apple into a ceramic fruit bowl resting near the sink, where soft steam rises from a recently used kettle.",
    "prompt3": "Amidst a cozy kitchen adorned with dark wood counters and vintage cookware, a bi-manual robot carefully lifts a bright green apple from a worn wooden tabletop. The sunlight streams through an open window, illuminating a potted herb plant and a clay pan beside it. The robot smoothly moves the apple and gently sets it into a basket on the opposite end of the table, filled with pears and oranges.",
    "prompt4": "A bi-manual robot delicately grasps a polished red apple from a matte stone countertop, surrounded by designer cookware and a sculptural indoor plant. The robot carefully rotates and transports the apple across the table, placing it onto a raised wooden cutting board staged for a gourmet demonstration.",
    "prompt5": "Inside a rugged industrial-style kitchen with exposed concrete walls and metal surfaces, a bi-manual robot grips a shiny red apple resting on a brushed steel counter. Around it, cast-iron cookware, a metal bread bin, and a utility sink add to the utilitarian aesthetic. Harsh directional light casts deep shadows as the robot rotates and places the apple onto a hanging prep shelf lined with other ingredients ready for chopping.",
    "prompt6": "In a cybernetic lab-style kitchen equipped with holographic UI panels and seamless surfaces, a bi-manual robot locks onto a synthetically grown apple using optical feedback and lifts it from a carbon-fiber counter. The space features neon edge lighting, a levitating induction pan, and a translucent data cube beside a smart herb pod. The robot repositions and places the apple onto a scanning platform embedded in the counter for nutrient analysis."
